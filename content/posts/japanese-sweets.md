When thinking about japanese cuisine, sweets and deserts might not be the first thing that comes to mind. 
But Japan has a huge variety of different deserts and sweets, also called Wagashi (和菓子).
While i'am not a the biggest fan of sweets, I found some things that I liked, and that I wanted to share.

First thing you notice is the huge variety of flavors for some of the international products.
KitKat for example has at least 10 times more flavors in Japan when compared to germany.

My favorite is Matcha KitKat. It's not that sweet, and I like that. It's also marketed as an "adult" taste.

My probably favorite traditional japanese sweets are Daifuku/Mochi (大福).
They are sweet sticky ricecackes filled with a sweet red pan paste (Anko).

Speaking of matcha taste, in japan matcha is a as commong as a flavor as vanilla in europe i would say.
Almost every type of sweet comes with a matcha variant
