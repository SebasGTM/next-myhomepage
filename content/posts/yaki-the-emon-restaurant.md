If you want to try one japanese specialties: Okonomiyaki, you should be on your way to Yaki-The-Emon in Düsseldorf.
The interior looks great, in old japanese style. Here you can find great dishes like Okonomiyaki, Teppanyaki fish and more.

My recommendation would be Okonomiyaki with cabbage, pork and Kimchi. See below:
