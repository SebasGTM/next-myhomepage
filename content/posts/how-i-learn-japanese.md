Here I want to give some tips and insides in how I started to learn the language, how it's going, and what resources I use.
I'm still far from were I wanted to be 
This is an ongoing article, and I will expand it as I increase my knowledge of the language. 


## The start

The first question is always: how do I start? where do I start? What is important?

If you are like me, and you don't enter any courses and want to learn at your own pace with online resources, I might be able to help you out a bit.
From what I've learned, and also from others that learned the language and are much 

The basic start is very simple, learn the japanese alphabet: Hiragana and Katakana
and basic grammar. Even if you want to focus primarily on the spoken language, you should have the alphabet down. 
Romaji (Japanese in the latin alphabet) is not a good representation for the language.

On PC I would suggest using a simple webpage like this one [Kana Pro](https://kana.pro/) or a similar app for your smartphone. This is probably the shortest but a very important step,
don't stop until read Kana in an acceptable speed. But it also should take more than a few days/weeks.
To speed up the process you can use a mnemonic chart. It did wonders for me and there are lot different version on the web.
Here an example: [Mnemonic Chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Japanese_Kana_Mnemonic_Chart.png)

After you mesmerized the Kana there are two next steps that should be worked on at the same time.

**Basic Vocabulary** and **Basic Grammar**


### 1. Basic tools

Some useful websites and tools that make your learning adventure easier.

 * [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) | Online japanese dictionary.
 * [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) | Google Translate. It's not the best translator, and you shouldn't trust it too much, but it lets you tranlate longer sentences and even reads them to you. Understands quite few idioms.
 * [10Ten](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10ten-ja-reader/) | Browser Add-on for Firefox and Chrome. Awesome tool. Will show a popup over japanese text with a translation. Great for japanese websites.![Title image](/static/post-media/how-i-learn-japanese/10ten_example.jpg#postimgtype)
    


### 2. Vocab learning

You will pick up vocab as you use the language, while you read, speak and write. But that is very slow process, 
and in the beginning you wont be able read or write anything if you don't know any vocab. 
Thats why you need to learn a base range of daily vocab down as fast as possible. If you don't, you will hate yourself while looking up **every single word** in a sentence.

So after memorizing the Kana you can immediately jump in to vocab practice.
There are multiple ways to do that, but i will show you how i did it, and it's also probably the easiest, most comfortable way to go about this.

My solution is Anki Flashcards.

Anki is a flashcard software/environment for all major platforms including mobile.

Download it here: [Anki Web](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) 
And you can use it on your PC, table or smartphone to create decks of cards with learn with. It's open source and without ads!
It also offers a free synchronization service for all your devices, so your process will be saved and you can continue from another device.

Normally you would have to create your own deck, but Anki lets you import Decks that others have created. That is probably the best part.
You can find all available japanese Decks [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/japanese)

And to make it easier for you, just start with this deck:

### 3. Grammar

If you visit any kind course, online or offline, you will pick up a lot of grammar from there. 
There are thousands of resources out there to learn japanese grammar, 
and one of the best basic and free grammar guides for the japanese language is Tae Kim's [Guide to Japanese](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/).
On the right you find the *Complete Guide* and you should read through it, ideally twice in row.
Also explore the other resources on the website.
